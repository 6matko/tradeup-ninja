              <p>
                Tradeup Ninja is a service for searching tradeups and storing tradeup results for further overview. In
                order to find profitable tradeups based on your search settings we
                request information about skins and their prices from our storage. All searches and combinations are
                calculated on your computer (more specifically via your browser with help of web workers). All added
                tradeups into our system are remaining in your browser. Tradeup information is stored in IndexedDB. You
                can export that information in JSON format to your computer and import to any other browser on Tradeup
                Ninja website. This way you will be able to save and restore your data. When tradeup result is added,
                updated or imported, related information gets calculated again. By using the Services, you agree that
                you understand that Tradeup Ninja is not responsible for any statements concerning tradeup not being
                profitable or losing your data. It is your responsibility to export data frequently and import it by
                necessary. After tradeup result import previous results are being removed even if import failed for any
                reason. This may occur if your export file got corrupted. In this case you can ask for help by
                contacting us at support@tradeup.ninja. We provide Customers with access to the Services as described in
                this Agreement.
