              <p>
                We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics
                collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and
                what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google
                Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on
                the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We have activated
                the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the
                European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to
                the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US
                and shortened there. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics
                with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your
                web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be
                used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
                about your visits to this site is restricted by the

                You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser.
                However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full
                functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the
                website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google,
                by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:

              <p>
                This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing
                statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based
                advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any
                specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in
                your Google account.

              <h3 id="privacy-gtm">Google Tag Manager</h3>
              <p>
                This website uses Google Tag Manager. This service allows website tags to be managed via an interface.
                Google Tag Manager only implements tags. This means that no cookies are set and no personal data is
                recorded. Google Tag Manager triggers other tags which, in turn, may record data. However, Google Tag
                Manager does not access this data. If tags have been disabled at the domain or cookie level, this
                remains in place for all tracking tags if these are implemented with Google Tag Manager. You can find
                out more about Google Tag Manager by clicking the following link:

              <p>
                For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page,
                your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
                For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus
                becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in
                the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified
                interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font
                is used by your computer. Further information about handling user data, can be found at
